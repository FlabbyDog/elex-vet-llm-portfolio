# About Me – Marie Elexis “Elex” Revilleza

I am a **Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM)** from the University of the Philippines Los Baños who moved into **AI-assisted veterinary education, call analytics, and virtual assistance**.

Most of my AI and technical skills are **self-taught through real projects**, not formal CS training. I learned by using LLMs directly in production workflows: starting from simple rewriting tasks and growing into multi-stage pipelines, prompt chains, and evaluation systems.

## Professional Focus

I sit at the overlap of three areas:

1. **Veterinary Domain Expertise**
   - Understanding of small animal practice workflows
   - Experience with reception calls, client communication, and clinical documentation
   - Helping new graduates bridge theory and real-world practice through structured learning content

2. **LLM / Prompt Engineering & Evaluation**
   - Designing complex prompts and prompt chains for:
     - Educational content (lectures, study notes, phone communication modules)
     - Clinical documentation aids and templates
     - Call analytics (extraction, scoring, feedback reports)
   - Comparing different models and configurations by:
     - Accuracy and hallucination rate
     - Coverage of required fields
     - Output structure and consistency
     - Tone and suitability for veterinary professionals

3. **Data Extraction & Analytics Workflows**
   - Turning unstructured transcripts into:
     - Structured fields (who, why, what happened)
     - Scores and labels (communication skills, missed opportunities, red flags)
     - Statistical summaries and dashboards for managers and teams
   - Moving from early Google Apps Script + Sheets prototypes to Python-based backends and Supabase storage.

## How I Work With LLMs

Because I learned everything hands-on, my process is very experimental and iterative:

- I start by **defining the task clearly**: input format, output schema, constraints, failure cases.
- I write an initial prompt, test it on multiple examples (including “edge cases”), and judge:
  - Did it follow all instructions?
  - Are all required fields present and correctly filled?
  - Is the tone appropriate for veterinary staff and clients?
  - Is the structure stable enough for code to parse?

- I then **refine prompts and compare variations**:
  - Prompt A vs B vs C
  - Model 1 vs Model 2 (for the same task)
  - Look for improvements in reliability, safety, and cost.

- When needed, I design **small annotation or scoring schemes**, so I can systematically evaluate model outputs instead of just “eyeballing” them.

I often use LLMs to help generate or refactor code (Apps Script, Python, basic JS), but I always:
- Test the code on real or synthetic data,
- Debug and refine prompts when the code is wrong or incomplete,
- Document what each piece of the pipeline is supposed to do.

## What I’m Looking For

I am open to roles such as:

- **AI Trainer / Data Annotator / LLM Evaluator**  
  - Especially where there is a need to define tasks, label schemes, and rubrics.
- **Prompt Engineer (Domain-Focused)**  
  - Building and iterating prompts for support agents, education, or analytics.
- **Veterinary Healthcare Virtual Assistant (VHVA)**  
  - Combining my domain knowledge with the ability to use AI tools effectively.

I am comfortable with **remote work**, asynchronous communication, and working with evolving systems where documentation and prompts are still being refined.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

Because a lot of my work happened inside private systems, this portfolio focuses on:

- **Structures and patterns** (prompt chains, pipelines, evaluation processes),
- **Anonymized or synthetic examples** (no real client data),
- **Code and templates** that show *how* I think and design, even if they are simplified versions of production systems.

If you’d like a guided walkthrough of any project or want to know how I would adapt these skills to your domain, I’m happy to explain my process in detail.
