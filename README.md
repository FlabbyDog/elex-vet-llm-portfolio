# Marie Elexis Revilleza – Vet-Focused LLM & Prompt Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Marie Elexis “Elex” Revilleza**, a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine who moved into AI-assisted veterinary education, call analytics, and virtual assistance.

I work at the intersection of:
- **LLMs & Prompt Engineering** – designing tasks, prompt chains, and evaluation rubrics  
- **Data Annotation & Analytics** – extracting structured data from messy transcripts and computing performance metrics  
- **Veterinary Practice Support** – phone communication, clinical documentation, client education, and reception workflows  

I’m currently looking for roles such as:
- AI Trainer / LLM Evaluator / Data Annotator  
- Prompt Engineer (especially domain-specific)  
- Veterinary Healthcare Virtual Assistant (VHVA) with AI/LLM tooling

## Skills Snapshot

- **LLMs & Prompting**
  - Task design, multi-step prompt chains, meta-prompts
  - Model comparison and evaluation (structure, hallucinations, tone, cost)
  - Designing output schemas for downstream code (JSON, tables, reports)

- **Data & Analytics**
  - Information extraction from call transcripts
  - Scoring schemes and rubrics for communication skills
  - Google Sheets + basic stats + dashboards
  - Supabase as a structured data store

- **Tooling & Implementation**
  - Google Apps Script [JS-based automation for Google Workspace]
  - Python (Google Colab, simple backend scripts)
  - Basic HTML/JavaScript dashboards for demos

- **Veterinary Domain**
  - Small animal practice workflows
  - Veterinary reception and phone communication
  - Clinical documentation and client education

## Portfolio Projects

Each project folder contains a **README with a brief overview** of context, my role, and example artifacts (prompts, code, sample data).  
For **more detailed explanations and actual sample outputs**, check the additional documents and sample files inside each project folder.

1. **LLM Call Extraction & Veterinary Call Analytics Pipeline**  
   `projects/llm-call-extraction-reporting/`  
   A combined, end-to-end system that:
   - Takes reception call transcripts and corrects diarization and roles  
   - Extracts structured fields (e.g., call direction, outcome, staff, client type, IDs)  
   - Scores sentiment and communication quality with custom rubrics  
   - Produces call-level reports and weekly performance datasets for analytics and training  
   
   This project shows how my **prompt design evolved** from early prototypes to more stable, production-ready multi-step prompts for extraction, scoring, and reporting.

2. **Multi-Stage Content Development System – Vet Phone Communication**  
   `projects/multistage-vet-phone-learning-system/`  
   A multi-prompt system for generating self-directed learning resources on veterinary phone communication (content structure, challenges, theory links, actionable advice, and intro modules).

> Note: All examples are either anonymized or synthetic. Any client or clinic data has been removed or replaced.

## How This Portfolio Is Organized

- `README.md` – this **high-level overview** (shorter / briefer)  
- `ABOUT.md` – more detailed story about my background and interests  
- `docs/` – supporting documents (e.g., PDF resume, diagrams, design notes)  
- `projects/` – each major project in its own folder, with:
  - A project-specific README (brief summary)
  - More detailed documents describing the system
  - Example prompts and/or code
  - Sample anonymized or synthetic data
  - Notes on my design and evaluation process

For deeper understanding, please refer to the **project documents and actual sample files**, not just the brief READMEs.
