# Marie Elexis Revilleza – Vet-Focused LLM & Prompt Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Marie Elexis “Elex” Revilleza**, a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine who moved into AI-assisted veterinary education, call analytics, and virtual assistance.

I work at the intersection of:
- **LLMs & Prompt Engineering** – designing tasks, prompt chains, and evaluation rubrics  
- **Data Annotation & Analytics** – extracting structured data from messy transcripts and computing performance metrics  
- **Veterinary Practice Support** – phone communication, clinical documentation, client education, and reception workflows  

I’m currently looking for roles such as:
- AI Trainer / LLM Evaluator / Data Annotator  
- Prompt Engineer (especially domain-specific)  
- Veterinary Healthcare Virtual Assistant (VHVA) with AI/LLM tooling

## Skills Snapshot

- **LLMs & Prompting**
  - Task design, multi-step prompt chains, meta-prompts
  - Model comparison and evaluation (structure, hallucinations, tone, cost)
  - Designing output schemas for downstream code (JSON, tables, reports)

- **Data & Analytics**
  - Information extraction from call transcripts
  - Scoring schemes and rubrics for communication skills
  - Google Sheets + basic stats + dashboards
  - Supabase as a structured data store

- **Tooling & Implementation**
  - Google Apps Script [JS-based automation for Google Workspace]
  - Python (Google Colab, simple backend scripts)
  - Basic HTML/JavaScript dashboards for demos

- **Veterinary Domain**
  - Small animal practice workflows
  - Veterinary reception and phone communication
  - Clinical documentation and client education

## Portfolio Projects

Each project folder contains a README that explains context, my role, and example artifacts (prompts, code, sample data).

1. **Veterinary Call Analytics Pipeline**  
   `projects/01-vet-call-analytics-pipeline/`  
   End-to-end pipeline to turn reception call transcripts into structured data, scores, statistics, and feedback reports.

2. **LLM Prompts for Call Extraction & Reporting (Beginner → Advanced)**  
   `projects/02-llm-call-extraction-and-reporting-prompts/`  
   Evolution of my prompt design for extracting fields and generating feedback, showing how I iterated from early prompts to more stable, production-ready ones.

3. **Multi-Stage Content Development System – Vet Phone Communication**  
   `projects/03-multistage-vet-phone-learning-system/`  
   A multi-prompt system for generating self-directed learning resources on veterinary phone communication (content structure, challenges, theory links, actionable advice, and intro modules).

> Note: All examples are either anonymized or synthetic. Any client or clinic data has been removed or replaced.
