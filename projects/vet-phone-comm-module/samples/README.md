# Sample Outputs – Veterinary Phone Reception Communication Module

> 🔎 These files are **sample outputs** from the multi-stage prompt system in this project.  
> This system is **one early component** of a larger ecosystem I designed for veterinary phone communication training.

All examples are **redacted** or written in a way that protects client and clinic privacy.  
They are here to show **what the prompts actually produce**, not to act as polished, final teaching materials.

---

## How to read these samples

The samples follow the same numbering as the prompts in `../prompts/`.  
Together, they show how one topic (the **“Initiating Connection – Professional Introduction”** phase of a vet phone call) is transformed step-by-step:

1. Define the topic and scope  
2. Structure sections, questions, goals, and supporting points  
3. Analyze challenges and generate solutions  
4. Map those challenges to theories/frameworks  
5. Turn that analysis into actionable advice  
6. Wrap it into module front matter (objectives, intro, self-assessment)  
7. Deep-dive on a single supporting point  
8. Review and critique the draft for content and depth (two passes)

> ⚠️ Note on completeness  
> - `01_content-structuring_output_redacted.md` – the original system produced content for **multiple sections**; for this portfolio, only **Section 1** is included as a representative slice.  
> - `09_content-depth-review-final_output_redacted.md` – this is **not the final published module**, but a more integrated **second-pass depth review** built on top of the previous draft and suggestions.

## File index

### 00 – Topic Definition

**`00_topic-overview_redacted.md`**  
High-level **Key Topic / Subtopic / Sections** definition:

- Key Topic 1: *Initiating Connection*  
- Subtopic 1: *Professional Introduction*  
- Sections 1–5 (Greeting & Self-Identification, Organization Confirmation, Vocal Clarity, Tone Modulation, Offer of Assistance)  
- Each section has clear start/end boundaries, which later prompts use to stay anchored to a **specific phase of the call**.

---

### 01 – Content Structuring

**`01_content-structuring_output_redacted.md`**  
Shows how Prompt 1 turns the topic into:

- **Supporting Questions**  
- **Goals**  
- **Supporting points**

for each section in the subtopic.

> Portfolio note:  
> Only **Section 1 – Greeting and Self-Identification** is fully represented here, even though the original system generated similar structures for all sections.

---

### 02 – Challenge Analysis & Solutions

**`02_pains-challenges-solutions_output_redacted.md`**  
Excerpt from the **Challenge Analysis & Solutions Report**:

- Identifies multiple **challenges** in the “Professional Introduction” phase  
- For each challenge, provides:
  - Why it matters / what makes it a pain point  
  - 3 concrete **solutions** with “Theory into Action” steps  
  - **Follow-up questions** for further reflection or coaching

This output is what Prompt 3 (“Theories/Frameworks”) builds on.

---

### 03 – Theories & Frameworks

**`03_theories-frameworks_output_redacted.md`**  
Maps the challenges from Prompt 2 to:

- Named **theories/frameworks** (e.g., standardization theory, brand identity theory, emotional intelligence, paralanguage, empathy mapping, Lean Six Sigma, CRM theory, etc.)  
- For each: what it is, why it matters in this context, how/when/who applies it, and practical examples.

This shows how the system **grounds practical advice in conceptual models**.

---

### 04 – Actionable Advice

**`04_actionable-advice_output_redacted.md`**  
Condenses the previous analysis into:

- A structured **Actionable Advice Report**  
- For each challenge:
  - One clear **actionable advice statement**  
  - **5 step** implementation sequence  
  - Optional **AI application notes** (e.g., speech recognition, sentiment analysis, decision support)

This is the “ready to implement” layer for managers and staff.

---

### 05 – Intro, Self-Assessment, Skills Gap

**`05_intro-self-assessment_output_redacted.md`**  
An example of **front-of-module content** for:

- Section 1: *Initiating Connection – Professional Introduction*  
- Includes:
  - **Learning objectives**  
  - A narrative **introduction** with rationale and light “evidence-style” stats  
  - A 5-item **self-assessment** with scoring bands  
  - **Reflection prompts** and a simple **skills gap analysis** + action plan

This shows how the system turns the earlier analysis into **learner-facing material**.

---

### 06 – Supporting Point Framework Deep Dive

**`06_supporting-point-framework_output_redacted.md`**  
Zooms in on one supporting point:

> “The greeting sets the tone for the entire interaction, making it crucial to get right.”

and expands it into:

- Detailed explanation from multiple stakeholder perspectives  
- Explicit connection to named theories (e.g., Communication Accommodation Theory, Expectancy Violation Theory, Uncertainty Reduction Theory)  
- Challenge analysis, misconceptions, and implementation strategies  
- Reflective questions and scenario-based exercises

This is the “theoretical upgrade” layer for one key idea.

---

### 07 – Expanded Supporting Point Draft

**`07_supporting-point-expanded-draft_output_redacted.md`**  
A more narrative, teaching-ready draft built from Prompt 6:

- Hook & goal  
- Extended explanation anchored in the **Integrated Veterinary Communication Initiation (IVCI) Model**  
- Theory integration, multiple perspectives, challenges, misconceptions  
- Solutions at both **individual** and **manager** level  
- Reflective and scenario-based exercises

This is the kind of text that could be adapted directly into **workbook pages, LMS modules, or scripts for training videos**.

---

### 08 – Content & Depth Review (First Pass)

**`08_content-depth-review_output_redacted.md`**  
Acts as a **reviewer/editor** pass over the draft:

- Summarizes current strengths  
- Suggests **content and depth enhancements**, such as:
  - A “Greeting Impact Cycle” diagram  
  - More explicit staff–client interaction cycles  
  - Case studies, matrices, measurement tools  
- Proposes evidence-based additions and structural tweaks

This demonstrates how the system can **critique its own output and suggest upgrades**.

---

### 09 – Content & Depth Review (Integrated Pass)

**`09_content-depth-review-final_output_redacted.md`**  
A second, more integrated depth pass that:

- Weaves in:
  - The **Greeting Impact Cycle**  
  - Behavioral economics (anchoring)  
  - Additional evidence and practical tools (e.g., Greeting Effectiveness Scale, journals, scenario matrices)  
- Strengthens the link between:
  - Greeting → client emotion → communication → decision-making → long-term relationship

> Portfolio note:  
> Despite the filename, this is **not the “final” teaching asset**.  
> It is a **more advanced review layer** showing how the system can iteratively refine content quality and depth.

## What this samples folder demonstrates

Together, these files show:

- End-to-end **prompt-chained content generation** for a real veterinary communication topic  
- How one topic flows from **outline → challenge analysis → theory mapping → advice → learning module → deep dive → multi-pass review**  
- How even an **early-generation, spreadsheet-orchestrated system** can produce layered, theoretically grounded training material when carefully structured.

For the higher-level explanation of the system design and prompt chain, see:

- `../README.md` (project overview)  
- `../DETAILED_OVERVIEW.md` (full prompt-by-prompt breakdown)
