1. 00:11-00:14 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Welcome to [REDACTED], Compton Road. You're speaking with STAFF_A.
2. 00:14-00:17 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Hi, STAFF_A, it's [REDACTED], [REDACTED]'s owner.
3. 00:17-00:18 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Hi, how are you?
4. 00:18-00:21 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Good, good, thanks. I've just got a message to call you guys.
5. 00:21-00:26 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Yeah, let me just pop them in a brief hold and I'll see where the surgery team's at. Won't be a minute. Thanks. That's okay.
6. 00:29-00:43 | s=+4|c=0.8 🔵 😊 AUTOMATED_MESSAGE: Every pet who walks through our doors has a whole team working quietly in the background to support them. And you, our nurses, gently comfort your pet during procedures. Our veterinarians interpret results and tailor treatment. And our client care team.
7. 00:44-00:46 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Hi, REDACTED, how are you doing?
8. 00:46-00:47 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Hi. Good, thanks.
9. 00:47-01:29 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😊 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): That's good. Calling about [REDACTED]. We've finished her procedure. She has gone really, really well. She's taking the anesthetic very smoothly. She is still technically in the recovery period. So there is not surprise. Yeah, yeah. So is still like a risk of something happening, but I'm keeping a close eye on her. But the. Both lumps have come off very well. He does have external sutures that would need to be removed in about two weeks time. And just being a greyhound, they're very vascular. There is a little bit of oozing on the sights. And so just to play it safe because there is a high amount of tension on the sites as well, I am going to cover with five days of antibiotics because I don't want to risk an infection.
10. 01:29-01:30 | s=0|c=0.8 ⚪ 😐 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Infection.
11. 01:30-01:31 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Risk it breaking down. Yeah.
12. 01:33-01:37 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 😊 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): I'll sort out a rashi vest as well. So she can't get at the wound at all.
13. 01:37-01:56 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😊 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): I think that's a good idea. Definitely, definitely. They both do have a little bandage on them that will just allow to fall off over the next few days. But she'll be due to come back for a recheck Friday just to make sure she's healing well, not having any problems. And when you come pick her up, a nurse will go through all the medications and everything. Yep.
14. 01:56-01:59 | s=+8|c=0.9 🟩 😄 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): I was gonna say. I can't tell you how relieved we are.
15. 01:59-02:18 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😊 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Oh, yeah, that's okay. She. She's done. She's done very well. All the, like, any problems that she's had, not that she's had many, have all been regular greyhound problems like soaking and taking a boatload of medications. But that's a very greyhound thing to do. They like to just soak in the drugs and let it not do anything. But I have.
16. 02:18-02:22 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😄 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): I'm not gonna say a word. I'm not gonna say a word about who she takes after, but yeah, sure.
17. 02:24-02:38 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Yes. No, she's done very, very well. So we aim to send her home around. I just want to have a bit of time with her to make sure she's all good. But if we send her home around 3 o', clock, is that okay?
18. 02:38-02:41 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😊 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Yeah, whenever you guys say it's okay. Absolutely.
19. 02:41-02:53 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Yeah. I just want to make sure she's all good. And then tonight we'll keep going with the transinamic acid starter other medications and I do think it's a good idea that we continue that heart medication twice a day as well.
20. 02:53-02:56 | s=+2|c=0.9 🟣 🙂 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Twice a day as opposed to want? Yeah. Okay, we'll change that now.
21. 02:56-02:59 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): Yeah, excellent. All good. Do you have any questions?
22. 02:59-03:01 | s=+8|c=0.9 🟩 😄 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): None whatsoever. Thank you so much.
23. 03:01-03:08 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): That's all good. All right. Fingers crossed we don't need to call you again before you come pick her up. Otherwise we'll see you at three.
24. 03:08-03:09 | s=+6|c=0.9 🟢 😊 Speaker B (CLIENT_REDACTED): Okay, lovely. Thank you very much.
25. 03:09-03:11 | s=+4|c=0.9 🔵 🙂 Speaker A (STAFF_STAFF_A): All right. That's okay. Bye Bye.
